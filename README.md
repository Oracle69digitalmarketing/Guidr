# Guidr | Your AI-Powered Personal Growth Companion

**Live Demo**: [https://guidr-sooty.vercel.app/](https://guidr-sooty.vercel.app/)

## 📖 Project Story

Guidr was born out of a simple observation: most productivity tools tell you *what* to do, but very few help you reflect on *how* you're doing. Inspired by the "Weekly Review" methodology and built for the **RevenueCat Shipyard contest**, Guidr is designed to be a thoughtful companion that bridges the gap between raw task lists and deep personal reflection. It uses advanced AI to guide users through structured coaching "recipes" that promote clarity, reduce friction, and align daily actions with long-term quarterly goals.

## 📦 Production Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel / Render)

Configure all `VITE_` environment variables in your deployment platform's dashboard. The app is optimized for Vercel deployment.

### Backend (Firebase Functions)

Deploy the Cloud Functions:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```
Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in your Firebase environment secrets or `.env` file for the functions.

### Mobile App (iOS / Android)

Guidr is pre-configured with Capacitor. To add mobile platforms:

1.  Build the web project: `npm run build`
2.  Add platforms:
    ```bash
    npx cap add ios
    npx cap add android
    ```
3.  Sync and open:
    ```bash
